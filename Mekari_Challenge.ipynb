            "I have been a Spotify user for years for a reason. Reasonably price and easy to use, I get access to music I love and the occasional rad recommendation that leads to an ever-growing library. When I meet new people who don't have Spotify, I convert them to a clearly superior music streaming platform. Honestly, at this point, Spotify owes me money!\n",
            "Spotify is brilliant, never looked back after downloading this, not only good with music you love, but also once it gets to know you, with the music or mixed albums its creates for you. I still use the free version as it suits my needs at this point, I always suggest it to everyone as it really is very good... i promise you wont be disappointed...\n",
            "I have been using Apple Music, Deezer and Yandex.Music before. And Spotify is the best music app for me! It works perfect, has the biggest library of the music and has the greatest design. The multi-device sync is crazy, cause I can control music playing on one device using another and I use often So I highly recommend it for you)\n",
            "This is GREAAATTTTT. Other than just listening to music it has a whole load of other cool features. Such as, the music just gets softer when another app is playing audio, unlike others who usually pause, It has a lot of shortcuts when you're listening via earphones, for example, a single click on the button pauses/plays the audio like normal but double tapping the button skips to the next song and triple tapping goes back to the previous one. Absolutely love it!!!\n",
            "I have a few complaints. it is a great app. but too many ads. why do I have to have an account for payment if I want to do a free trial? why only 6 skips an hour? why can't I listen offline? why do u add songs to my playlists? why do I need to verify, to get the student plan? why can't I search for a certain song on mobile, but I can on computer? also lastly, why isn't my wrap up working? I do love this app, but those are my complaints. I love music and this app. but these things are annoying.\n",
            "As it seems the previous issues are resolved, I'm giving back the rating of 4 stars... I do have a suggestion for the home screen widget - widgets of other players save (at least the view of) the last played item and pressing play acts as a shortcut to resume playing it. It would be nice if Spotify's home screen widget would do the same, but it clears up as soon as the app is closed. Would be nice if the cover art of the last played item could stay visible and to resume playing from there.\n",
            "Suddenly the Spotify App at morning stopped working properly, like Ads play but song's don't. Also the liked song's list is shown empty and all playlists are missing (this all happens, even after updating today to the latest version). Tried changing accounts, but to no avail. The same accounts work fine on other phones. The app has a specific issue which shows up on my phone.\n",
            "one of the best if not the best music app around. The UI is great, simple and easy to use. The selection of songs and the playlists that are created most use the music preference of the users.. keep up with the good job.\n",
            "Almost everything I have ever wanted to listen to I have found in Spotify. The UI is easy to navigate, easy to make playlists, share playlists, and share the account with another person. I like that I can control pause/play/forward/back from the first screen of my phone and I like that it seemlessly plays in my car.\n",
            "The service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. Most frequently I just listen to my \"Liked Songs\" playlist. I choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when I get out. Anyone with a brain would think I'd want to continue listening from where I left off, right? So why is it that when I reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? This is incredibly irritating. I would give 5 stars if not for this.\n",
            "It's a pretty good music app better than most of them. However there a WAY too many ads. Also the randomly add music to your playlist that you didn't add and it takes forever to go back through and delete them. Even then some random songs still play when you shuffle through your playlist. But this app is still the best music app there is.\n",
            "I was logged in using my Samsung account, which gave free premium service for 3 months, I also setup payment method to pay after first 3 months. But I can't login after reinstalling the app, now I'm afraid I will be charged when 3 months get over, but I can't use my account!\n"

They also criticize the recent redesign of the user interface, which they find confusing and difficult to navigate.\\n\\n2. **Declining satisfaction with the music library**: Users are increasingly complaining about the limited selection of music available on Spotify, particularly in certain genres and regions. They also express concerns about the removal of certain songs and albums from the platform.\\n\\n3. **Increasing competition from rival streaming services**: Several users mention switching to other streaming services, such as Apple Music or YouTube Music, due to dissatisfaction with Spotify's app or music library. This suggests that Spotify faces growing competition in the music streaming market.\\n\\n4. **Demand for higher-quality audio**: A significant number of users are requesting support for high-fidelity (HiFi) audio streaming, which offers a superior listening experience. Spotify has yet to introduce this feature, which could put it at a disadvantage compared to competitors who do offer HiFi audio.\\n\\n5. **Concerns about misinformation and censorship**: Some users have expressed concerns about Spotify's decision to host controversial content, such as the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has been accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19. This has led to calls for Spotify to take action against such content, which could impact its reputation and user base.\\n\\nThese trends and patterns suggest that Spotify needs to focus on improving the user experience, expanding its music library, and addressing concerns about misinformation and censorship. It also needs to consider introducing HiFi audio streaming to remain competitive in the market.\"}"
